**Calculation of Temperature from measured KBr $T_{1}$**

tempcalc_kbrt1.py:  The script calculates the temperature of a sample based on the KBr T1.
It is based on the paper: K.R. Thurber, R. Tycko, Measurement of sample temperatures under magic-angle spinning from the chemical shift and spin-lattice relaxation rate of 79Br in KBr powder, J. Magn. Reson. 196 (2009) 84â€“87. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2008.09.019.


tempfromKBrt1.pynb : This is the Jupyter Notebook to do the same in a pretty fashion.
